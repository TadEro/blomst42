# what's this
this is a personal minecraft resourcepack i'm creating. to make things interesting, i decided to restrict myself to only use colors from an indexed palette for all textures.

# what does the name mean
"blomst" is Norwegian for "flower" and 42 is the amount of colors the palette i'm using has (also funny number). i chose "flower" since the palette is called Rosy-42.

# what software are you using
Aseprite.

# have you used GitHub before
not really. sorry for the mess.
