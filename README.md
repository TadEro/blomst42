# what's this?
this is a personal Minecraft resourcepack i'm creating. to make things interesting, i decided to restrict myself to only use colors from an indexed palette for all textures.

# what does the name mean?
"blomst" is Norwegian for "flower" and 42 is the amount of colors the palette i'm using has (also funny number). i chose "flower" since the palette is called Rosy-42.

# what software are you using?
Aseprite for textures, and BlockBench for models.

# have you used GitHub before?
this is my first time!

# when will the pack be finished?
i dont have an answer for that. it could take years! i'm only doing this for fun.
